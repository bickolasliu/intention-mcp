# Intent Tracking Enabled
# This repository uses the intention MCP server to track AI-assisted changes

When editing files in this repository:
- Use intention_edit for file modifications (captures reasoning)
- Use intention_write for new files
- Use intention_search to understand previous implementation decisions
- Check intention_history before making major changes
- If you use standard file operations, call intention_log afterwards

To view intent history for a file, use intention_explain.
