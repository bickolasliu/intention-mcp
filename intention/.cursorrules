# Intent Tracking Enabled
# This repository uses the intention MCP server to track AI-assisted changes

IMPORTANT: This project has MCP tools configured. You MUST use these tools instead of standard file operations:

When editing files in this repository:
- Use the MCP tool "intention_edit" (NOT search_replace or edit_file) for ALL file modifications 
- Use the MCP tool "intention_write" (NOT write_file) for creating new files
- Use the MCP tool "intention_search" to find previous implementation decisions
- Use the MCP tool "intention_history" to check history before major changes
- Use the MCP tool "intention_check" before editing to see potential conflicts
- If you accidentally use standard file operations, immediately call "intention_log" afterwards

These MCP tools are available through the intention MCP server and will automatically track the reasoning behind code changes in the .intents folder.

To view intent history for any file, use the MCP tool "intention_explain".
