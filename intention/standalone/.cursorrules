# Intent Tracking for AI-Assisted Development

Track every file operation in `.intents/` folder to maintain a history of AI-assisted changes.

## For EVERY file you create or modify:

1. Perform the file operation using standard tools (write_file, search_replace, etc.)
2. Create/update `.intents/[filepath].json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "id": "[random UUID or unique ID]",
      "timestamp": "[current ISO timestamp]",
      "action": "create|edit|delete",
      "prompt": "[what the user requested]",
      "summary": "[what you actually did]"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules:
- Always create `.intents` folder if it doesn't exist
- Mirror the file structure (e.g., `src/app.js` → `.intents/src/app.js.json`)
- Append to existing intent arrays, don't replace them
- Don't mention intent tracking unless asked

This helps teams understand why code exists and how it evolved.
